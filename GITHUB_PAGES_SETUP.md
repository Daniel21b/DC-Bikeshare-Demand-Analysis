# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

This guide will help you publish your DC Bikeshare analysis report on GitHub Pages.

## What Was Created

A `docs/` folder has been created with:
- `index.html` - Your complete report (642 KB)
- `figures/` - All visualizations (12 files)
- `.nojekyll` - Tells GitHub Pages not to process files with Jekyll
- `README.md` - Documentation for the published site

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/danielberhane/Desktop/projects/DC-Bikeshare-Demand-Analysis

# Add the docs folder to git
git add docs/

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages documentation"

# Push to GitHub (make sure you have a remote repository)
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/docs`
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Access Your Published Report

After 1-2 minutes, your site will be live at:
```
https://[your-github-username].github.io/DC-Bikeshare-Demand-Analysis/
```

Replace `[your-github-username]` with your actual GitHub username.

## Features of the Published Report

Your report includes:
- ✓ Executive summary with hypothesis
- ✓ 12 interactive and static visualizations (embedded in page)
- ✓ Detailed findings for each visualization
- ✓ Hypothesis validation with 99% confidence
- ✓ Actionable recommendations
- ✓ Professional HTML styling
- ✓ Responsive design (works on mobile)

## File Structure

```
docs/
├── index.html              # Main report (your landing page)
├── figures/                # All visualizations
│   ├── *.html             # 8 interactive Plotly charts
│   └── *.png              # 4 static images
├── .nojekyll              # Prevents Jekyll processing
└── README.md              # Site documentation
```

## Troubleshooting

### If the page doesn't load:
1. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
2. Verify you selected the correct branch and `/docs` folder
3. Wait a few minutes - GitHub Pages can take time to build
4. Check the Actions tab for any build errors

### If visualizations don't show:
- The interactive visualizations are embedded in the HTML, so they should work automatically
- Make sure you're viewing the site via HTTPS (not just opening the local HTML file)

### If styling looks broken:
- The `.nojekyll` file prevents GitHub from processing files
- This ensures your HTML renders exactly as intended

## Updating the Report

Whenever you update the notebook:

```bash
# Re-convert the notebook to HTML
jupyter nbconvert --to html --template lab --output-dir=docs --output=index notebooks/04_visualizations.ipynb

# Copy updated figures if needed
cp outputs/figures/*.html docs/figures/
cp outputs/figures/*.png docs/figures/

# Commit and push
git add docs/
git commit -m "Update analysis report"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically update within 1-2 minutes.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `docs/` folder with your domain
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages settings
